This source allow you the library functions to create, destroy, view and modify a dynamic LinkedList.
The type of the list is a struct with a pointer that allow you to use whatever datatype you want.

You have to write only the structure and few function. There are two examples to understand how to use this library.

All functions were tested with valgrind and no errors were detected. 

NO dangling pointers. 

NO memory leak.
